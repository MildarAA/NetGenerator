# NetGenerator
Cyberpunk red NET architecture generator

First choose difficulty 1-4.

Map of architecture is generated. Every floor is identified by number 1-18 (ID). Path on left is always longest and contains the bottom.

Legend explains what every floor contains. It is rolled by levels (not IDs) as described in core book so deeper you are the worse the enemies are.
It looks like this:
{Floor ID according to map}: {Node/Password/Program/Black ice}

In the end press Enter to generate a new one or Escape to exit. Added this little thing for users not running this in command line that would accidentally delete the whole dungeon

PS.: Every branch has only 30% to be created. That is why linear dungeons are usually generated.
